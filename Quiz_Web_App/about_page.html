  <h3 id="who-is-this-website-for">Who is this website for?</h3>
  <p>Geography is about spatial distribution of phenomena. It is best learnt through interaction with maps. This is an attempt to provide visual medium to spatial learners. This website is targeted mainly at people who want a quick way of refreshing important concepts related to Indian and World geography.</p>
  <h3 id="paid-version">What is included in the paid version?</h3>
  <p>The paid version includes access to all the maps as well as more content to be added in the future.</p>
  <h3 id="where-did-the-idea-come-from">Where did the idea come from?</h3>
  <p>My friend was spending too much time revising maps, and I thought there had to be a better way. India has millions of competitive exam aspirants who could use a resource like this. Unfortunately, there is very little India-specific interactive map content. This is my small effort to fill that niche.</p>
  <h3 id="will-you-add-more-content">Will you add more content?</h3>
  <p>Yes, and I am taking suggestions! Reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1295738368634961921" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you want to chat. </p>
